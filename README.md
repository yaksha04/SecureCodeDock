SecureCodeDock is a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline project designed to automate the security scanning, containerization, and deployment of a Python application. This pipeline integrates modern tools like Docker, Git, and Python to streamline continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), while embedding real-time security analysis using Bandit — a Python static code analyzer.

🔥 Key Features
Automated Security Scanning:
Uses Bandit to perform static analysis of Python code, detecting potential security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

Containerization with Docker:
Automates building Docker images and running containers, ensuring consistent environments and simplifying deployment.

Real-time Terminal Dashboard:
A Python-based CLI dashboard displays detailed deployment logs and security scan reports, providing instant insights into the pipeline’s status and security posture.

Custom Shell Script Pipeline:
A centralized shell script (pipeline.sh) orchestrates the entire pipeline — scanning, building, containerizing, and launching the dashboard.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Docker: Containerization and environment consistency

Git: Version control and source code management

Python: Scripting for scanning (Bandit integration) and dashboard visualization

Bandit: Static code security analyzer for Python

Linux Bash Scripting: Orchestrating the pipeline workflow

🚀 How It Works
Security Scan:
The pipeline runs Bandit on the application source code to identify security vulnerabilities and generates a detailed scan report.

Containerization:
A Docker image is built from the application and deployed as a container, enabling environment standardization.

Dashboard:
The Python CLI dashboard reads and displays logs and scan reports in real time, helping developers and DevOps engineers quickly identify issues.
